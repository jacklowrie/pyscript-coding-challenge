# Pyscript Coding Challenge

This Demos how to set up a python coding challenge that runs locally in the browser (no server-side untrusted code execution). Only one challenge is provided, but the configuration is stored as a dictionary in `challenge.py`, demonstrating how this can be adapted to support many challenges (in a database) readily.
